xxxviii REMARKS ΟΝ SALLUSPS sina

dides is very noticeable in Sallust’s writiugs, alike in
matter and in form. His countrymen ventured to
pronounce Sallust equal if not superior to his Greek
model, both as a writer and as su historiam To such
a position Sallust has no claim, but to have been in
his turn a model lor Tacitus is no slight merit⁷.
Under this head Ι giveaiew examples of Eanum
In the omission of the parts oi aum, Sallust is holder
than any writer except Tacitus. Est, suat, erat, mosset
are often omitted, whether used as copula or abso·
lutely, both in dependent and principal sentences,
especially in descriptions oi places, battles, and cha-
racters There are instantes also of omission ol sum,
sumus, sit, fuerit, essa, sore. Esse is always omitted
afterputare, pati, videre and often aiter reri. When csse

Thuo. 7. 71, 2-4.

⁷ Tacitus’ familiarity with Sallust‘s writings is shown byhis
imitation of several phrases (Drilger, S. u. S. des Tacitus, p. 125).
He calls Sallust ‘the most brilliant of Roman historiausss 1
may add heres word asto Livy’s opinion oi him, as it has to
do with imitation. Seneca Contr. 9. 1. 14 says, ‘Titus autem
Livius tam iniquus Sallustio fuit‚’ that he aritioized his phrase
‘res amatae mire ruat vitiis optentui (Or. Lep. 24) as sn imi-
tation, and s bad imitation, oi Thucydides’ (though by the
way it is not Thucydides, but au inexact quotation from De-
mosthenes) δεινιιὶ ’γὰρ ul εὐπραξίαι συγκρύψαι καὶ συσκιάσαι τὰ
ἑκάστων ἁμαρτήματα. Seneca puts Livy's low opinion of Sal-
lust down to jealousy. u ha could show, says Seneca, that
Thucydides was superior to Sallust, Livy thought that it
would be au easy thing to establish his own superiority to
Thucydides If it be true, however, that Livy was not among
Sallust's admirers, the difierenee oi temperament oi the two
writers would sufficiently explain the lact.
