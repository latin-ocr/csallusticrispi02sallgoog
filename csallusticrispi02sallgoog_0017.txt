private and public vices of the timesl

Something of a consciousness that he was inviting
such a retort, of a feeling that he could not say of
himself what he puts into the mouth of (lato-qui

sarcastic tone of his writing, atone rather of violent
irritability and disappointment than of genuine moral
indignation.

The large infusion of moral reflectione and judg-
