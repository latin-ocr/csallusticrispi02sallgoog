3. Sallust 11 will bc observed puts the meeting at Laeca’s
house before the passing 01 the sctum (29. 2). 1110 clearlya
mistake‚ which has thrown this part 01 the narrative into con-
fusion. Linker and Ottema attempted to throv the blame on
a transposition 01 11100110010011110 original 01 all our MSS,
and wished to put 27. 3 postserra-28. 3 susceperant 0110131, 4
Panlo. They are obliged however at 31. 5 10 01101 postremo to
postero 110 ¹and 10 insert Catilina 0110100000. That theory is
now however given up even by tha thorough-going defendere 01
Sallust at the present tima Indead the mistake is rather
cherished by Dietsch (ed. 01 10001. 43 ,4100100οο comitium,
qno res ordinasset, 000 indignam essa scriptore, qni ornate 00000
tenuiter 00001100 in modurn scribere 0001101), Α. W. Zumpt, and
others, as a striking instance 01 Sallust’s advance upon the
meagre annalista, and 01 his admirable ideal method. Rather
itis a striking instance 01 Sallust’s 111111101οη00 10 accuracy,
and neglect 01 the most obvious sources 01 information. His
acquaintance with (licero's two first Catilinarian speeches must
have been very superficiei. »

per 11. Porcium 10000111] Jordan quotes, in support of the
per 01 the MSS, 44. laed Aliobrcpes es praecepto Ciceronis per
Gabinium ceteros conveniant. But the difficulty which has
been 1011 10 1101 in the expression itself‚ but that S. should not
have known that the meeting was held at Laeca's house, or that
knowing itha 1111101 say so. The 1001 surely was notorious:
Cic. 111Οο1. 1. 4. 8 Dico te priore nocte 0001000 inter falcarios-
000 apam obscure—in M. Lassae domurn: p. Sulla 18. 52 qaid

0000011111 The correction 01 Ρο1101011 penes (which Dietsch
adopts) is surely out 01 the question. Penes is never used as a
precisa equivalent 101 apud (Ter. Adelph. 38001000 iantpenes
uos psaltriast. 1110010100 e. q. s. is the nearest instance per·
hapa). Better is the correction propere cd (propere per 28.2
below). The propere will account 101 the per, but is perhaps
better away; the original omission 01 the ad 10 explained by the
termination 01 00000001. Ῑ doubt however whether aiter all
there is much difficulty in supposing that S. did not care to ·
mention the detail that the meeting was held in Laeca's banse,
or even that he did know that it was so. He was quite at sea

about the 0100, why should he know the 010001 (Tha ibi is
not either in favour 01 0 change: it need mean no more than
‘at that meeting '. cp. 5. 2.)
