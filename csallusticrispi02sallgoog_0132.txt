367 non aetate veram inpenie adipiscitur sapientia. Other
deponent participles used passively by S. are—dilargitae eniens
interpretatas ludificatus machinatus.

incesserat] Dietsch, on the strength ci Sallust's fondness
for frequentatives, takes this to come from incessere. As it is
always used, when taken in a figurative sense, in the perfect or
pluperfect it is difficult to refute that. but it probably comes
from incedo. The verb takes an acc. in Ep. Mith. 15 inopia
rursus antas incessit: a dat. in G. 31. 3 mulieres, geilan rei
publicae nrapnitudine beili iinrcr insolitas incessit.

4. simul ac] is used here only in Sallust. Ubi prinam,
which is elsewhere used, is here avoided because oi the paneam
immediately preceding.

was the iashion to find more amusement', and Dietsch says
‘After speaking oi the universal system of training ior youth
he goes on to show the result produced on the minds of each
and all’. But the plural is probably an unintentional gram·
matical slip. A plural verb with a collective substantive is nc
more a recognized construction in Sall. than it is in Cicero
or Caesar. Livy is the first good prose writer to make a con-
stant use oi the construction. Pars is found sometimes, it is
true, with a plural verb, but it is always there coupled with alii,
panai, etc, and is rather in apposition with the true subject
tham itself the word agreed with. of other collectives there
are only two instances. J. 73. 3et Rornae plebes litteris, qnae

both these instances and in· the latter the anan has not been
