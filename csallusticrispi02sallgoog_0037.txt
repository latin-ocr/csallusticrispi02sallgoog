xxx BEMABKS ΟΝ SALLUS'FS STYLE.

person, Sallust uses ths lenguage of an unaffected
man oi the world⁹.

The ancienta then, were struck mainly by the
archaisms3 in the present day, however, it is con·
tended that Sallust’s partiality ior Oouvnasfflowan
nxrsassiorts is quite as marked. N o ancient critic, I
believe, notioes this point, but that perhaps need not
excite surprise or incredulity. Many words and ex-
pressions, of course, tend to drop out of literature but
continue in the spoken language, so that the archaia
and conversational often coincide. But nevertheless
not only does Sallust uss not a few words and ex-
pressions, archaic from the point of view of literature,
which happened to bo also part oi the everyday speech
oi the time, but many words and turns, which have
come direct irom conversational language³. So much

may be taken as fairly established. But when Wolf-
flin describes Sallust's style shortly as ‘vulgar demo·
crat's Latin ²-that gives an exaggerated idea of the
prevalence of colloquialisms in Sallust dordan once
more strongly denies the justice of this description.

² The reader may be reminded oi: -ere for -eruat, crippli·
cia=aupplicationes, perditum ira, hoaoem ferire from the G. not
in speeches, but see the notes passim. Jordan gives no evi·
denae except that according to him the forms-color, odos,
labos-were employed only in speeches‚ and thetrarcatum, his
conjecture in J. 10214, occurs in an indireet repert of a
speech. Jordan’s language, which I quote, gives on the other
hand a rather exaggerated idea oi the archaic tone of the
speeches.

³ Aa samples may be taken: paynel-ua, which occure only
in S. and Apuleius, portatio in S. and Vitruvius. Populares
(=soeii) must come rather from the serino plebeius than the

s. cotidianus.
