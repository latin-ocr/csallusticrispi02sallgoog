the origin of Rome which Sallust, rejecting Romulus, adopts,
came no doubt from Cato, who is reported by Servius on Verg.
A. 1. 36 as saying, primo Italiam tenuisse quosdam qai appeb
v brbaatar Aborigines, postea adveatu Aetnae Phrygibus iaactoa
Latinos arto nomiae nuncupator. The description oi the Abo-

' , riginos, which occurs with little variation inOic. de inv. 2, Varro

and Vitruvius, comes, according to Jordan (Krit. Beit. p. 359),
from Dicaearchus, whose ideal pertraiturs oi these peoplc is
extant The Romans pronounced the name AborigInes (Ἀβο-
ριγῖνες in Strabo eta). Itis Greek according to Rubino (Beitr.
ziir Vorgeschiohte Italicus, p. 47) and means ‘inhabitante oi
the mountain-valleys’. He regards the account given by Sal-
lust as so iar historical as that the Latin nation were formed
by a anion of these Aborigines, who came from about Amiter-
num, and some immigrants who came by sea. The identification
of these settlers with Aeneas and his followers was a later

Greek addition. ·

cumque ela] The gae ie generally appended to the follow·
ing word and not to a monosyllaba proposition, when the prop.
is not repeated. Cumque, as here, is said to occur in Cicero
only seven times, but degere (cp. G. 48.5 degae ea re) seventeen
times.

agreste] in a bad sense. (lp. Cic. Rosc. Am. 27. 75 vita

gentiae iustitiae aragiatra est.

slne legibus, slne imperio, liberum atque solutum] An in-

.·' · liberam. The arrangement of four words in pairs, the first

pair without copula, the second with atque, is very common in
S, eg. amaia cadaveribus, eruore atque lucta: odio amicitia,
ira atque misericordia: patriae pareatibus, aris atque socia.-
taetra inculta, sceda atque formidulosa.- laetitia maeror, lactas
atque gandia: etc.

2. alli] It is necessary surely to leave P (which has
aliae) here, for the meaning ie that one people lived in one
way, and the other in another, not that the individuale lived in
all sorte of different ways.

1tabrevl...erat] This sentence, which is wanting in the
best MSS, is introduced by Augustino (see critical notes)
among quotations from Cicero and Sallust. It has been
claimed for Cicero’s Republic (1. 25. 40). The appearance in
this place is probably due to somebody familiar with Augus-
tine's works patting them down in the margin. Is auch a sen-
tence needed here? Aa Jordan well says, it is essential that
we should be told that a state was formed, and the finishing-
