Rornae socii incerta patrarfsaent] Thera is a decided gap in
the narraticn here. Lentulus (44. 6) and the other conspirators
in the city (48. 4) appear to have expected Catilina to come into
the neighbourhood of Rome before they struck out, while
Catilina in this passage and below (58. 4) expected that they

5. servitia...culus] Arelative or demonstrative pronoun
in the plural referring to a singular collective noun is commen,
but the converse, as we have it here, is hardly to be paralleled.
Compare, however, Or. Mac. 15 aa voa ad virilia illa vocem,
quc tribunos plebei, modo patriciam magistratum,...mciorer
vostri paravere. Liv. 42. 8 bonaque ut eia, quicquid eius recu·
percra' poscit, reddantur (under the influence cf the formula-
qaod etas facere potaris). Thuc. 1. 80. 3 ἀλλὰ τοῖς χρήμασιη
ἀλλὰ πολλῷ ἔτι πλέον τούτου ἐλλείπομεν. The fact that bofh
seruitium and servitia are used in this sensa will perhaps
explain the slip. Kvlbala as the only parallels that can be
produced are of things and not of persons, makes coniurationia
the antecedent, comparing for the order J. 14. 15 fratri, quern
minume decuit, propincus per scelus vitam eripuit (where pro-
pfurua is the antecedent tc qaam).

alienum salutationibus e. q. a] Cp. 44. 6. Catiline's
scruples with regard to the slaves are merely aa to employing
thern in his arrag. He had no hesitation over getting them to
cooperate in the general pillage (cp. 24. 4, etc).

ch. er, 1. postquam...pervenlt] peruenit is the perfect.
When postquam is followed by the historical present in the
Oatiline, the verb is always video. In the Jugurtha other
verbs are so used—intellegit putot volt comperit instruit urgent,
etc. Note also thatin S. the postquem-clause never follows the
principal clause, though that position is not rare in Tacitus.

reliquos] How many of the l2‚000 were left after this
desertion S. does not say. Appian talhs cf there having bean
20,000 at the battle, though only a quarter of them, he says,
wera regularly armed. Perhaps Dio (37. 40) is not far wrong
when he gives the number as 0000.. Metellus had (ἓ 0) lacco
men,b and Antonius (Dicar. 39) was stronger than Metellus in
num ers.

ln aarum Pistoriensem] Pistoria (Pistoja) in N. Etruria,
cn the southern slopes of the Apennines.
