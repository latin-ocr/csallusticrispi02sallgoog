these chapters in their proper place, but it again is

Besides the MSS, the earliest of which belongs per-

haps to the 9th century, wc have earlier help towards
the determination ol the text in the quotations by
grammarians and scholiasta, by the Fathers and other
writers ; and hints may now and then be gleaned from
