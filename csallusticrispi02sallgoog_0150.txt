1181111111 narration is to be cleared of all improbabilitics, λ

where are we to stop?

transtulerant] The pluperleot for the aorici-perfect. This
use 11 more common in S. than perhaps in any other author,
cp. G. 24. 2, 36. 5, 50. 4, 56, 2, J. 57. 6, 64. 4, 711, 1111111
4, 88. 3. The reference to the time before which the action
happened is left to be supplied by the reader from what follows.
These pluperfecte were perhaps in Seneoa’e mind when he
epoho of Sallust's verba ante expectatum cadentia et obseura
brevitas In the present instance S. ie thinking already os the
second projected attempt. (For Livy, where the use is not un-
common, aee Kiihnast, p. 213: it is common too 111 Curtius.)

7. tam tum] 171111 on 5th Feb. their designa embraced
both senators and consuls, while 1111111- on 1 lan-they were
content with the consule. Herzog explains—‘then already, as
on other occasions afterwards’.

8. patratum] The word isafawouritc of Salluet’e, but is ,

eschewed by Caesar, Suetonius and Pliny. Cicero has it only
twice: 1111111. 1. 14. 77111111 promissa patravit, and from an
old law in Legg. 2. 8. 19 feriis iurgia ne mouente 1111111 in
famulis operibus patratis habento. In Sallust’s time 11 had
probably 1111111, into being 1 along, if not a coarse word, only
(Quint. 8. 3. 44 on uariatum-ductare 1111111111 11 patrare

bella apud Sallustium dicta sancte etantiqua, ridentibus 11 -

g? planget). S. however revived 11, and Livy and Tacitus follow
1 11.

Gh. 1⁹, 2. st] explicative-‘many respectable people
thought Piso would prove 1 counierpoise against the power of
Pompcy‚ for Pompey's power was already alarming'.

3. inprowlnofa] The in procirscicrn ο1 P certainly will not
do. The order of words and the context show that S. cannot
have meant in prouinciam...iter faciens, and no other explane-
tion of the reading 11 admissible. Cassius 11111111 (ἦ γε·
ρουσία) εὐθὺς αὑτὸν ἐς Ἰβηρίαν, πρόφασιν ὠς καὶ ἐπ’ ἀρχήν τινα,
ἔπεμψε· καὶ c' μὲν ἐνταῦθα ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιχωρίων, ἀδικήσας τι αὐτοὺς,
ἐσφάγη. Asconius, p. 83, ibi (in Hispania), dum iniurias pro·
vinciaiibus facit, occisus 1111, ut quidem credebant, a On.
Pompeii clientibus Pompeio nen incito.
