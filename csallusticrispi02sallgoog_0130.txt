3. postquam...vldebatur] ‘after that it began to appear '.
Op. 56. 4 postquam Aaroouo cum coercita adventabat. The
construction of postquam with ind. impl. reached its height in
Livy. For p. followed first by perf. and then by impl. op. 10. 1
note on patebant.

4. pauet] ie. only a few.

aberant] ‘kept themselves out ol’ with an active sense,
as in caes. B. G. 6. 14. 1 Druides a bello abesse coruscarunt.

5. auxtlta portabant] ior serebant. Op. 42. 2 portatio-
m'bus. Liv. 45. 1 laetum acutiam portabant. Ov. Pont.
3. 4. 1 portantia uerba salutem. The strictly classical use oi
portare is, as Doderlein says, de retus grauioris poemia.
Sallust’s use of the word and the two examples I have quoted
show the beginnings 01 its usurping the place of serre, which it
ended by altogether supplanting. Compare with instances
already given Cic. Fin. 2. 35. 118 opem salutemque ferrer.
Cicero writes to his brother 2. 10. 2 cum homiuem portarem
ad Baius Neapoli octaphoro Atticiano, but Verr. 5. 11. 27 lectica
octaphoro serebatur. Caesar says always sarciaco conserve,
but the author of the Bellum Africanum uses comportare.
Later authors write: berufieta portare, auspicia portare. Apu·
leius has suppetias portare, and even aetatem bellule portare.
(Op. French portur.)

magisque dandis aas] From Thac. 2. 40. 6 οὐγὰρ πά-
σχοντες εὖ ἀλλὰ δρῶντες κτώμεθα τοὺς φίλους.

6. reipublicae consultabant] S. is lond of using the fre·
quentative for the simple verb, and so here consultare takes the
meaning and construction ol coenatore. The construction is

lonnd here only-except for an imitation by Aurelius Victor ,

(uh century).
