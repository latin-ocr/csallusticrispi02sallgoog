that was no doubt his object) to ths Allobroges. Perhaps it
was this word which led Appian astray, who says (2. 7) Κατι-

have made his way irom Picenum to the egrese of the pass
in no mora time than it took Catilina maenis itineribus to
get irem the neighbourhood of Faesulae to Pistoris-a distance
oi only about 25 miles? Hagen supposes that the facts which
S. has confused ars, that Catilina as soon as he was avare of
Antonius’ approach wished to get over the monntains to
Picenum, where the conspiratore had been active lor sometime
(27. 1·; 42. 1), but that when he found Metellus posted at ths
ioot of the hille he determined to try to escape along the vallcy
of the Arno eid Pistoris, but that at that place he iound An·
tonius awaiting him. But it is hardly necessary to go so far
afield to make Sallust's account probable. Aa has been already
noted 01130. 5, Metellus’ command was not confined to Picenum
but included also the territory of the Senones Galli, emended,
that ie, north oi Ariminum, and he did not surely wait ior
deserters’ information to bloolr the exit 01 Pistoris to the north.
-Catiline would havs the choiee of two passas irom Pistoris to
Gallia Cisalpina, the ons by the Reno valley to Bologna-the
modern railway route, the other oid Pievcpelago along tho
Scoltenna ralley to Modera—,the Via Eatenee. It was hythe
former probably that Catilina intended to go. We must
