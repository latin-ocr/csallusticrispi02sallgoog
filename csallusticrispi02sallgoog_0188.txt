7. machinatum] There is probably no instance 01 the
passive use 01 this participle before this. It occurs again in
two fragments, but adjectivally used H. 2. 23. 3 vum 1111111011

(111. 40, 1. neque pretio neque gratia ciceronem inpellere
potuere] Priscian: queo, quivi vel quii. S. iu 0. sed ueque pretio
aeque qratia inpelli quivit. Septimius (11 imitator 01 Sallust)

lish quivere against the MSS? But ii Priscian (1111101111.) is
not sufficient authority for quivere when he quotes especially ior
that word, not much weight is 10 be attached to his contradict·
ing the MS reading ueque precibus neque pratia oeque pretio in
apert of his quotation which is immaterial to his purpose.
The 1111 that the two words pretium and qratia are osten
coupled, not only in other authors, but in S. himself (he writes,
pretium aut qratiam: pretio 1111 qratia: pecuniae aut proiice),
is 10 great objection 10 his strengthening the phrase in one
instance, but does explain very well why Priscian (quoting
from memory) should give the words as he does. Dietsch adds
that precibvu rs contained in qratia. They are not synonyme,
however, and the meaning may well be ‘neither by entreaties,
nor by offer of services, nor by money down ³-a elimax. That
Sallust should spealr with some emphasis hera in clearing
Caesar—tha one aim of his book according to Mommsen-is ·
not nnnaturel. (of late authorities, however, Kvldala alone as
for as I know defends the MS reading. Kortte and Kritz, how-
ever, found 10 difficulty in 11.)

2. uterque-exercebant] uterque here only in S. with
plural (30. 4 11 uirique ad urbem imperatores eraut). The
construction however is not rare in Livy. Caesar has Bo.
