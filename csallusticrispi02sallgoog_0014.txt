INTRODUOTION.

0. Samusrrus Onrsrus was borninthe year 668(86)
at the Sabine town Amiternum ¹, of a plebeian family.
Of his early life we hear hardly anything 3 buthe no
doubt went through the regular course of instruction
of thc time, and apparently with success, for he was
inclined (so hc tells us) as a young man to devote
himself to literature. The attractione of political life
proved however irresistible. After holding the quaes-
torship, he became tribune of thc pcople in 702, and
at once set himself in opposition to Milo and to thc
Pompeian party in general. In the year 704 he was
eipelled by the censors from the Senate on the
pretcxt that he was leading a scandalous life. Hc
then betook himself to ansar’s camp, and served in
the unsucccssful expeditione against the Pompeian·
forces in Illyria. In 707 he was restored to thc
Senatc by means of Gaesar's influence‚ by whom he
was sent to treattwith the mutinous legions in Cam·
pania, where hc narrowly escaped assassination. Hc

¹ A moramentis now on loct, I believe, at Aquila, near
the site of the ancient Amiternum, to erect a statua there, and

¹ to establish a library of MSS. inscriptions etc. having to do
with Sallust’s works.
