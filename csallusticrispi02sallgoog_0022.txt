had the invectivas against Oatiline and the speech
ior Murena before him ¹⁴.

'Phe most obvious mistalreis the antedating of the
meeting at the house of Laeca. Sallust seems to have
fitted it in where it would be useful to himself, with·
out examining the facts of the case¹⁶. But it is only
one instance of the great historical perversion that
runs through tho whole monograph Sallust makes
no attempt to traca the development of Oatiline's
schemas. He introduces the conspirator breathing
five and slaughter from the first. Even from the
time oi Sulla, according to Sallust, Oatiline had de
termined to make himself tyrant. This vieW, which
no doubt the efforts of Cicero had been successful in
making the popular view, suited Sallust’s teste en-
tirely. But he has not been skilful enough, nor was
he unsorupulous enough, to clear away the improba·
bilities of a treatment which spreads the drama of

, a few months over a series of years. One cannot in
reading Sallust's pagos help asking oneself once and
again, why,if Catiline's determination was from the
first a headlong anarchical plot, he lays such stress on

¹⁴ According to the not improbable statement of Suetonius
(ds Gramm. 10) a certain Ateius Philologus furnished the
facts for Sallust to work up. He provided him breviario verum
mnium Rooroeurum ea quibos quos vellet eligeret. On these
probabis reminiscenees from the Catilinarian invectivas see
notes on 15. 2; 20. 93 51. 9; 52. 35.

¹⁵ Sallust felt perhaps that the story was getting impro-
bable-so much vagus preparation and so little definite action.
It is to explain that that S. makes Catilina complain of his
followers’ ignavia, though it is not clear what they had sailed

to do.
