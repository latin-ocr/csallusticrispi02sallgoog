xii INPRODUCTION.

any Roman writer which would stand beside 'I'hucy-
dides. It was hie ambition to supply the want.

That could only be done by oflering as complete
a contrast to the tedicus annalistae possible, and
Sallust neglected no means oi giving variety to hie
work. From Thucydides he probably horrowed the
idea of his introductione, the imaginary speeches⁹,
and the character portraits¹⁰ 5 from (lato the pictoresque
descriptione oi the soenes oi historica] events, and
the ethnogrephical digressione. And not ohly with
the help of such exterior decoratione does Sallust
seek to excite interest, but in the handling oi the
facts oi history he is at paine to bring out the general
tendencice to which they point, to deduce irom the
past the causes which have led to the incidente he
describes, to pourtrey the moral condition of the
times, to assign the motivas which guided the actore in
the drama.

With thie abundant superstructure, it is not un-
· natural that we have often to complain that historica]
truth and accuracy tend to fall too much in the back*
ground, and that Sallust is more oi a rhetorician than
an historiari. That, however, was not an objection “

⁹The speeches‚ which in the Catilina take up almost a
quarter oi the whole book, in ‘the Jugurthe occupy not more
than a sixth. In the Histories‚ from which we heve probably
all the syneches, the amount must have been still further

reduced.

¹⁰ The pertraiture of characteris perhaps Sallust'e strong-
est point. The contrasted pertraite of Cato and Caesar in the
Catiline have seemed to many writers, and not without reason,

to form what was intended to be the hemel of the work.
