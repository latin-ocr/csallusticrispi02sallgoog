a. praeterea esse] supply ‘he said’ trom polliceri.

Ρ. Sittium Nucerinum] an eques oi Nuceria in Campania.
Catilina, or rather Sallust, is inaccurete here. Sittius leit Rome
ior Spain in the year 690-64 (cp. Sic. p. Sull. 20. 56), and
Piso was already dead in June or July oi that year (Asconius,
p. 83 Piso aarum, cam hacc (the Or. in tog. caud.) dicerentur,
patriarcali—Probably then Sittius was sent out to succeed Piso.-
Sittius ewever does not appear tc have been long in Spain.
He went thence to Mauretania, where he commanded a
mercenary force. He returned to Rome alter the suppression
oi the conspiracy, but to escape a prosecution-presumably
ior complicity therein-he started off again ior Spain, en route
for Mauretania. There he acted as a very successful ‘aon
dottitre’ ior many years. Later he did good service in the
African War 708 (46), with Sallust therefore—It is cuncus
that Sallust cneus suspicion on Sittius while he spares
Sulla. If Sittius was an accompliee, so was Sulla (see (lic. p.
Sall. 20). S. treats Crassus and Caesar with the same respect
elpersons (Crassus 17. 7, Caesar 49. 1).
