said that tha eligarchs hed a monopoly of the magistracies.
It certainly looks too as if ipsi audaciores were‘meant as a
division of the eligarchs (Fabri quotes 20. 7, but not very
aptly, to show that ceteri need not be so taken), More serious
ιοο and suspicions is the gae which many editors, who other-
wise retain the MS reading, striks out; it is very out oi place
(cp. 51. 30 iacta boram et malos lubidinose interficere, ceterae
raet-a terrere), and its presence in the best MSS gives colour to
the alteration of BitschL He adopted Kritz’ qai for qao, but
altered the order—ceterae, gai plebem ia magistrata placidius
tractarent, iudiciis terrere. The reading oi our MSS may
have arisen from tha words plebeae-tractarent being accident·
ally omitted, theu added in the margin and afterwards copied
into the wrong place, gai being altered to gae and qua inserted
to make sense. The meaning will then bez-The extreme
aligarchs frightened their milder colleagues, who (or-because
they) did not treat the people with sufficient harshness‚ with
legal proseeutions. Ishould not however be disposed to abendon
the MS reading, aa iuterpreted above, lor this alteration.
Would Sallust, with his affection for the indicative, have used
the subjunctive? (0. 52. 8 fecissem is the only at all parallel
instance as far as I know.) The meaning given to p. tractare
is not probable, cp. J. 41. 2 aare απιο Carthaginem deletam
popularet sectatae Romarm placide audertegae inter ae rem
publicam tractabant (they managed ιο share the government
and yet ιο keep the peace), Tac. A. 3. 12 simulque illud repa·
tate, turbide et aeditioee tractaverit exercitae Pisa, The first
interpretation seems to me more suitable to the context and

¹ to Sallust’s treatment ol the subject elsewhere thau tha other.

Ha takes no account of the moderate politicians‚ and with
Thucydides before him (3. 82. 8 fi, here ἢ μετὰ ψήφου ἀδίκου
κατογνώσεωςι other echoes will be found in J. 41. 42 and else-
where), represents the history of Rome ae in the main a see-saw
