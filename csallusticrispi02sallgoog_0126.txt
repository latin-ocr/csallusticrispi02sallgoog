Sallust's translation for Thucydides’ τῷ δ’ ὑπερβάλλοντι αὐτῶν. ’

3. propatore, e. q. a] Here ae often the contrasted words
are arranged rather with a view to sound than to exact eor-
respondenoe. Audacia answers to gador, and for the others—
offioes are sought no longer by worth (virtue) but by bribery
(largitio), nor are they administered with abstinentia, but only
ior gain (avaritia).

their substitute, is found only three times in S. (0. 2. 1, 5. 4,
21. 4). In Teo. rapido by degreee entirely supplanta cupiditas.
In his smaller works cupiditas is used four times, capide onoe:
in the Hist. rapido is live times as eommon as copiditas: in
the dnn. sapiditas is not used at all.

eadem qua] Eadem qaae the reading ol P, whioh Kortte

eriam eadem quae eeteros sama atqua invidia, and Linker—
b. cupido vexabat me eadem sama atque invidia qaae ceteros
vexabat-will hardly do. And even if we read qaa it seems a
strange form of expression. Kortte's oonj, whioh Dietsoh
adopts, eadem >eademque qliae, would remove all difficulty.
(Cupido eademque eeteros is lound in some MSS.)

lieve that S. meant to eall agrioulture, at any rate, whioh
Roman opinion so highly valued, an oooupation unworthy
of a free man (cneio. 0ff.1.42. 151 omnium autem remam,
