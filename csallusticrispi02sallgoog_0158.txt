-xx1v.a] uocas. 105

habebant: as the writer geta further away from the subject
sense overrides grammar.

quamvis egreglus] ‘however distinguished'. Quamvis is
used only once again by S. and also withan adj. (spes) qaue
quamviacmpla. Or. Manto.

pastinare] ‘ fell into the background ’.

ch. 24,1. comitiis habitis] seems tc mean ‘et’ and not
‘after the comitia’, asin (lic. Phil. 2. 32. 81 si qui (de caelo)
servavit, ιιοιι comitiis habitis, scd priua quam habeantur, debet
nuntiare. Kritz (lemnes, however, saying nondam enim absolutis
et ad fiam perductis comitiis, νοοιι poterant ἀοοῑοτανι· necti cosa
sulse. But certainly the declaration was made st the Comitia.
For a similar coristic use of the perf. pass. part. cp. Liv. 2. 36. 1
servum...sub furca caesum medio epact circo (cio. Div. 1. 26. 55
writes servas per circum, cum virgis caederetur, furcam serena

ductus est).

2. concusserat] Kvtcala explains the tense thus ‘after-
wards however they recovered from the shock and supported
their leader energetically’. Roby ἓ 1489 quotes this passage
under the heading ‘the standard of time is sometimes not
given till a subsequent separate sentence’‚ and it is more
natural to explain it with reference to the following sentence,
‘Catiline’s rage was not cheeked ior a moment by this repulse,
while his associates had at the first experienced ascvere shoek’.
See note on 18. 6 trcmtaleract.

neque temen] as you would have supposed after this re·

peonnam...sumpram mutuam] For the coupling of both
a participle and an adjective to one substantive, cp. Liv. 32.

order of words). J. 12. 3 quem ille casn ministrum oblatum
monstrata onerat.

Faesulas] Fiesole, close to Florence.

Manlium] The Greek historiens, Plut. Gic. 14, Dio 37. 30,
Appian B. Ο. 2. 2, call him Mallius. Manutius tac. on Cic. ad
Att. 4. 3. 3 give him the cognomen of Acidinus. Plut. id.
ἄνδρα τῶν ἐπιφανῶς ὑπὸ Σύλλᾳ στρατευσαμένων. Dio id. Γάϊός
τις Μάλλιος τῶν τε πολεμικῶν ἐμπειρότατος (μετὰ ’γὰρ τῶν τοῦ
Σύλλου λοχαγῶν ἐστρατεύετο) καὶ πολυδαπανώτατος ὤν.

pnncepsrnt bellltactundt] (lic. Phil. 5. 16. 44 (θοοοοο)
ipae princeps exercitus faciendi et praeridit comparandi suit.
