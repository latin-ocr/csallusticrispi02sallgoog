t. post illa tempora] i.e. when the period ot renewed tri·
bunieial activity began, ep. post domtnationem in t. 6. Distsoh
thinks the reference oi iila too vagus ior the perspicuous
Sallust, and reads ex conj. post Selloe tempora-in 28.4 P
has centonas, pernitionis, for ec Sationis.

honestis nominibus] Η. 1.1o penei potentes, quamnim
qratiam plerique concesserant, seb honesto petrem aot plebei
nmnine dominationes adfectebent. Sall. clearly had before him
Thnc. 3. 82 οί γὰρ ἐν ταῖς πόλισι προστάντες μετ’ ὀνόματος
ἑκάτεροι εὐπρεποῦς, πλήθους τε ἰσονομίας πολιτικῆς καί ἀριστο-
κρανίας σώφρονος προτιμήσει, τὰμὲν κοινὰ λόγῳ θεραπεύοντες ·
ἆθλα ἐποιοῦντο, παντί δὲ τρόπῳ ἀγωνιζόμενοι ἀλλήλων περιγί-
γνεσθαι ἐτόλμησάν τι τὰ δεινότατα, ἐπεξῄεσάν τε τὰς τιμωρίας ἔτι
μείζους κ.τ.λ.

4. neque illle modestia neque modus contentionis erat]
ep. 11. 4 neque medem neque modestiam victores iubere. The ’
iliis refers to both parties. It is not necessary to striks it out
with Kortte; nor to read, as Eussner proposes, neque illis mo-
destia neque modes his contentionis erat, which would make S.
draw a carious distinction between the want of moderatiora oi
character in the oligarchy, andei moderation in acts in the
popular party.

Ch. ee,1. As Mommsen says, Sallust is clear that the
Gabinian and Manilian laws dealt the democracy a deadlyblow.

2. innoxii] is here passiveinmeaning,=inwiolate. 311 is

used in another sense 40. 6.) Other adjectivae so use are

10. 1 neque ea ree saianm me babuit-where salsas means

‘deceived'. i. 17. 6 solumi corpore (soleretis generally means
‘health-giving’).

ceterosque iudiciis terrere, quo plebem ln manento pla·
eldius uastarent] The sense seems to be: The eligarehs (ipsi)
resorted to legal praesentiens, to detor the other officials (tho
tribunes principally) from stirring up the people against them.
The passage however is a difficolt one, and such an explanation
is not free horn objection. That the tribunats should bs
called a rneqietrates is no difficulty,cp. t.37.1 tribomt' pletis
„contineam meqistmtnm nitebanter3 but there would bea
contradiction, though only a verbal ons, as it has &aab *osen
