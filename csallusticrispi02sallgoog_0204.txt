29. prosperaomntaeedunt] Thereisnonaedwithlaaobs-
Wira to read prospere with P1 because oi J. 63. 1 taneta pros-
pere ereatura, and G. 26. 6 aeque petitioneque tralatae...
prospere cessere, ior it goes ou qaae occulte temptaverat aspera
taedaque evenerant. Liv. has both prosperam evenire 42. 28 and
prospere evenire 5. 51. 5.

30. Δ. mannus rorquatus bollo Gallteo] The story is
alluded to in G. 9. 4. There is a double mistake here, ior aooord·
ing to all authorities (Liv. 8. 'l ; Gia. Gall. Flor.) his name was
Titos, and it was notin the Galba war 393 (361) botin the
Latin war 414 (340) that the incident ooeurred. It was in the
Gallio war that he got bis name Torquatus. Dietsoh reads Τ
for Abbult εἱίΙοοα not propose to alter Gallico. It is better to
leave ot one.

34. Gablnto smalto] Vreverses the order. The reason
is plain r elsewhere Statilius is put before Gabinius 17. 4, 43. 2,
46. 3, 55. 6, clearly beoause Statilius was (wado not know how)
a more important person in himself or in the oonspiraoy than
Gabinius. He is also put beiore Gabinius in the Setum (Gis. in
Get. 3. 6. 64). Perhaps the greater importanee of Statilius is
shown by 44. l. If as is probable V is wrong hera, it yet
shows that the eompiler of the selestion from which the MS is
derived was a very diligent reader of Sallust.

35. c. eum exercitu arabus urget, alit intra moenia atque
ln sinu urbis sunt hostes] Cp. Cio. in (lat l. 2. 5 costra sarit

unlihely that this passage was running in Sallust's head, but
Linker went too far when he proposed to further assimilata the
two passages by reading here ‘ eam eaeroita in faucibus Etruriae
