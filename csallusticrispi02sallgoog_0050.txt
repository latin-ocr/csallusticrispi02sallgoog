That the MSS. oi the two first classes come (ashes Ἰ
been shown lor other authors) more or less directly

from one and the same manuscript is almost certain. · ’

The following is a neat indication oi this. In J. 103. 2,
a line or two before the big lacuna, tho mass os the
manuscripts have a senselesafiliciter (which is altered
in some to a hardly more satisfactory flectitur). Ac·
cording to Kortte’s certain conjecture, it is aglons,
put by tho writer or reader oi the original manuscript,
who thus expressed his satisfaction at the turn things
were then taking ior the Romans, or, more probably, ’
thus solemnly noted the conclusion under the cir-
cumstances oi the work. (cp. the title of the Oratio
‘ad Cursorem...dc republica incip. felicit') ·
From what source the missing chaptcrs were
supplied in the MSS. oi thc second class it is im-
possible to decide. The loss os them cannot have
happened at avery carly time, ior a grammarian of the
5th century quotes from them: they appear again in
MSS. oi the llth century. une MSS. which contain
them haud them down to us in so peculiarly corrupt
a stete, and with so many variants, that, ii they were
supplied by the recovery oi the lost sheets oi the
original MS„ these particular sheets must have been
written in some very illegible way or have been much
injured. Itis more likely that another, a very ill· .

written and corrupt but complete MS. came to light
in the llth century, and that the writers oi tho inter-

loolred at Isound‚ for instance, the following version oi (l. 35. 1
exemplum eorum litterarum cat scriptum infra Lucius Catilina
