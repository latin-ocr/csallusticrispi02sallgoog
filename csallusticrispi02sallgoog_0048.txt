to be used (in J . 66. l, eleven). Single historical
infinitives however occur-often to give variety of
construction. (2) When, as generally the case, more
than one infinitivo is employed, a summing-up sen-
tence is generally added, the verb of which is (c)
sometimes another historical infinitive, e. g. 0. 14. 6,
where the sentence is introduced by postremo (in
other cases prorsas ita denique are found) 3 (ὂ) sorne-
times an imperfect indicative, e. g. 0. 25. 5 prorsas,
Ο. 60. 4 without any introductory adverb. [In J. 65.
5 an historical infinitiva sums up after finite verbs]

or transitive verbs used absolutely-express generally
some external action, or, if they denote a feeling, it
is generally manifestatione of feeling. Posse how-

used, though it is sometimes broken up into pore-
atii, etc. ‘ (5) In J. 98. 2 Sallust uses the hist. inf.
after cum tomen, and cp. J. 70. 5, 100. 4. Livy has it

after cam interim in 3. 37. 6. Tacitus does not scruple
to use it freely in subordinate clauses. (6) It is rare
for the hist. inf. to be introduced by the pluperfect;

often, passive: 0. 10. 6 vindicari, 27. hsotiqori.
