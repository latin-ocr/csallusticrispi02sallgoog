AND THIl ΤΕΧΤ. · xlvii

nothe supposed that it is a carefully written or con-

sistently correct manuscript The writer was a some·
what illiterata person, it is clear. He gives us for

instance inuentae simulacltelli (for iuventas simal ac
belli), quem censores senata (that word added above
the line) probri qratia amaaeraat and Piso adulescens
nobilissimae audaciae, and other things oi the same
kind. But the MS. irom which he copied was no
doubt a difficult one to read As obvious mistahes
have not as a rule been chronicled in the notes a few
words may be said on this not unimportant subject¹¹.
Many slips the writer himself corrected, and others
were put right by a somewhat later hand3 but many
remain. Oi these a large number fall under the
following headsz—(a) words are sometimes wrongly
divided, either in the way oi running separate words
together, or by splitting up one word into two:
(b) words are lengthened by putting in a syllable in

the middle: (c) words are shortened by omission oi a
syllable: (l) wrong terminatione are putto words

¹¹ of these errore I give s few examples, chcosing mainly
such ss have not been corrected at sll or very unsuccessfully :-
a) wrong division: ennianae (for : es Sullanis), simalaehelli
(simul ae belli), nobilissimae (nobilis samniae), ideo (ld adeo),
minoresant (minares saal), scam et (suamet), fregere ant
(fenerant), illeeon sumeret (ille censuerat), sormi dolosa (sor-
midalasa)-l›) lengthening: astitutlae (aetaliae), eoresaltando
(casallo), meminimus (Memmius), vectigales (vigiles), proeli-
arentur (proeliantem-c) shortening: dissili (dissimili), pri·
mam (plurimam), libertale (liberalitate), ples (plebes), obsidet
(obsideret)-d) wrong terminatione: foret (sore), acere (ageret),
rapiebat (rapiebatur), peterentur (peterent) ete, mcxcimas leontios
copias (m. hostiumn), ἀοτηοε suos (el. scas), etc.
