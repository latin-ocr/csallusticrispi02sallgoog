96 SALLUSPS Cri siclus. [xvru. 3

As to what were the rights of the consul in refusing an in·
tending candidate’s name authorities are divided. Lange main-
tains that an impending criminal prosecution in itsell debarred
a candidate. Mommsen is of opinion that the matter was en-
tirely in the discretion of the consul, though that Tullus· refusal
cn this occasion was a rather unusual, ii not high-handed
proceeding. Perhaps however Dr John's middle position is
nearer the truth-that if the prosecution had got so far as the
sortitio iudicum a man was necessarily excluded. In the case
of Scaurus the prosecution do not avail themselves of an iu-
terval of 30 days allowed them to collect evidence in Sardinia,
so that the trial may get on lar enough to prevent Scaurus
standing ior the consulship (Asson. Arg. of Cic’s speech).
The same with the case of Clodius and Milo: the aim was that
Cic. ad Q. f. 2. 1. 2 sortitione iudicum sacta comitio haberentur.

It is very doubtful whether S. is right in representing the
plot to have been to make Catilius one of the consuls, instead
of Sulla. ln his defense oi Sulla, Cicero of course declares
that it was Catilius who was to be consul; but it is curicus
that in the copious list oi Catiline’s offences in the Or. in tog.
cand. and in Asconius’ comments nothing is said of such an
attempt cn Catiline's part, though the projected slaughter of
the senate is mentioned. Other authorities too-Livy's Epito-
mator, Suetonius, Cassius Dio-make the plot to have boen to
restore the unseated consuls by force. Catiline‘s part in this
first conspiracy was probably a very subordinate one, und its
real directors Crassus and Caesar. Even Sallust seems to
disconnect this plot with Catiline’s true conspiracy in the
parenthetioal way in which heintroduces his notice of it.
(What evidence there is will bs found Cic. p. Sull. 24. 67, Liv.
Ep. 101, Suet. Jul. 8.)

6. ea re cognita] ‘as the plot got to be known'. The
logical subject of the abl. abs. is not here, as it should be, the
subject of the sentence. Cp. J. 10. 1 parvom ego, Iugurtha, te

meaning, Dietsch holds that as the text stands Sallust's
account is absurd. Is it conceivable, he asks, that no public
action should have been taken, and the conspirators have had
only to postpone the execution for a mouth? Cassius Dio 36.
27 says that the new consuls being wamed of some danger
provided themselves witha guard, and that that prevented the
execution of the design. Probably S. said the same, but it has
dropped out. He marks a lacuna therefore before eo re, and
the filling up would be-‘ths consuls, wamed oi some danger
determined to provide themselves withan armed escort ’. But
