NOTES.

Tan Trana or rna Woaa—What did Sallust call the mono·
graphi· For the title which it bears at the present day, de conire·
ratione Catilinae (taken from C. 4. 3), there is no authority.
= The nammuiaus describe the work in a variety of ways, but
, never in thia. Priscian writes (always 1 believe) in Catilinare'o
(sc. bello), Nonius in Catilinae tello, and elsewhere we find in
Catilinae intorta, and the convenient in Catilina is often used.
Onr best MS (P) calle the book at the beginning bellant Catali·
nariam, and at the end bellan Catilinae. There ie little doubt,

then, butthat the word Bellula came into it Wdlffiin says ‹

“In contrast to Cicero, who liked to describe the movement ua
a civilia coniuratio (Ep. 5. 12. 2 quoted in note to 4. 2 carp-
tim), the historian laid stresa on the designation bellan, asa
protest against Cicero's verse, Cedant arnna togae connectat
narrentani& WasitthenBellnn CatilinariunorBellarn Cati·
linaei Probably the latter. Quintilian (3. 8. 9) describes the
two vorke thus-in bello Iugurthino et Catilinae. And Florus,
who took his account irom Sallust (see note on 61. 2), calls his
chapter on the conspiracy Bollane Catilinae. The adjective
Catilinorine iu fact does not seem to occur till Priscian, a
native oi Constantinople, ventured on it. (Catilinarum isthe
true reading in (lio. in Cat. 2.10.te; and Plinythe elder wrote
Catilinianne.) It was avoided, as Wb'lffiin thinks, because os
the double meaning oi which it is capable (seenoteoni. 1).
Priscian however does not suruple to call the orations against
Verres-Veniant. ’

Aword on another question suggested by the two titlee in
P. Did not perhaps Sallust write Catulinae? Prof. welfflin
writes n nte: “There would be no difficulty, iivve might as·
sume that Sallust called his work Bollane Catulinae: then the
fora-title is moderniaed by the substitution of the adjective
which came into vogue aiter Prisoiau, but the n is retained;
while the after-title has retained the genitive, hut lust the a.
