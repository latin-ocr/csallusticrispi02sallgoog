possible an exposition of Cato’s character and political views,
{30 lead up to the contrasted pertraitures of two admirable
man types.

Sallust is so anxious to get on to contrast the characters of
the two speakers that he outs the rest of the sitting short. The
consul could apply the elocare when he liked‚ and it is not
likely that the perroyata'o was continued further after (lato's
speech, a speech which put the senate into a great state of
exaltation and a good deal of confusion. Further debate how·
ever arises about (lato's proposui, either before the voting or
in the subsequent drawing up of the decree. Cato seems to
have included in his proposal that the property of the con-
demned should be confiscated Το that Caesar vigorously ob-
jected; it was not fair, he said, that the mild part of his pro-
posal should be rejected and the severe retained. When tha
senators could not be persuaded, Caesar called upon the tri-
bunos to intervene, but they refused. Cicero however took
upon himself to omit the proposed confiscation. As Caesar
was leaving the senate-house armed equites draw their swords
upon him. But Curio throws his toga over Caesar, and (licere
too gives them a sign to desist. (Suetonius' (Jul. 14) account,
that the equites entered the senate-house and forced Caesar
with these drawn swords to desist from further appositior, is
probably incorrect.)

ch. 68, l. sententiam etus nudam] Willems quotes this
passage to show that senators ot especial authority were allowed
to rise again to express in a few words their opinion of a dis·
course that had just been delivered. But surely all thetis
meant is that (lato is cougratulated by his admirere, and that
senators express to one another their admiration of the speech
-all in a quite informal and probably noisy way. Liv. 9. 8. 13

continuous favour cf fortune, not eloquence nor military glory
-but a constant supply of a few great men in each succeed-
