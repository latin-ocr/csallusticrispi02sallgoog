PREFAOE.

Tun text here adopted is that given by Pro-
fessor H. Jordan, of Kdnigsberg, in his second
edition of 1876 (Berlim Weidmann)‚-see p. xlviff.

References to the authorities whose names are
quoted will be found in the second index. Here
I may mention one or two books to which I am
especially indebted. The editions of Kritz and
Dietsch are well known ; not so well known per·
haps is the excellent German commentary of Fabri
(1845). What fruit the study of Sallust has pro·
ducsd of late years has to be sought chiefly in

meguuines and reviews. But my obligations are
perhaps greatest to Jacobs and Wirz’ school

edition, and, of smaller school editions, to the pithy
little commentary of Schmalz in the Bibliotheca
(lothario. The compilation of Constans dc Ser-
morw Sallustiana (Paris, 1880) is of much service.
