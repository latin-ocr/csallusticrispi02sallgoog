oi it Itonos think there is muoh in these obiectione but
Herzog‘s and Krita's alternative interpretation will not ‹io-to
make nyctos the object oi scire, ‘that he lrnew nothing but
about the ambassators' (ie. that they had a hand in the oon-
spiracy)‚ for there is no parallel ior nibil used oi persons. The
interpretation of Jacobs will however give the same sense. He
makes legatos subject to in ea coniuratione esse-‘that he knew
nothing but that the ambassadors were in the conspiracy,
though he had heard from Gabinius more than once that this
and that person were ooncemed in it'.

2. ex libris sibyllinis] montemontano. S. die-

doubtful.

4. Ρ. Lentulo Spintheri] and Q. Cornificio, both energetio
members of the aristocratia party. The tormer was active as
consul 697 (57) in agitating for Cicero’s recall, the latter was
candidate ior the consulship with Cicero. Nothing is known
