xlviii NOTES ΟΝ THE MANUSORIPTS

The mistakes of the MS. Ρ1 (to be mentioned below)
are oi a similar character, and they suggest perhaps
certain conclusione as to the character of the MS. from
which they both como. In that MS. it would seem
words were not divided from one another, and abbre-
viations were often used ior the terminatione of
verbs and nouus and also for middle syllables¹⁹. It
may be added that the constant mistek'es between
a and u, and sometimes between f and s, show that
the original was in cursivo character.

Another important and peculiar MS. is preserved
in the Vatican Library at Rome—Vaticanus 3864 (V).
It is of about the same date as P. Of Sallust it con·
tains the speeches and letters from the Oatiline and
Jugmtha, four speeches and two letters from the
Histories¹³, and also a speech and letter ‘cd Caesarem
serrem dc republica ’-both of them undoubtedly spu-
rious. The corrector of P agrees with V in the parts
they have in common, and perhaps this second hand
(p) took these corrections irom V. The variatione
between P and V are mainly in the order of the
words ; and, while in the genuine speeches V gives
a later spelling (optimus calyce cult etc), in the
speech and letter to Caesar we find e. y. Ilici, ipnwrei,

¹² I gratefully aeknowledge here my obligations to P. Klim-
scha’s Sauusuanisohe Miscellen. 1882. Hc is cl opinion that
such mistahes ss ceccaum (maiorum), opstat (aicbat), regi
(rei), comebat (hiemabat) point to soma parts at least having
bean dictatori.

¹³ Has V preserved all the speeches oi the Historias? Jor-
dan thinks sc. Tha number seems small, but the ethnogra-
phioal discussions and geographical descriptione would supply
a good deal of omamentation.
