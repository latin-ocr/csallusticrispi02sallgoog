Another critic (M. Hertz) proposed 10 striks out intra nweac'c
01900, supposing that intra emenia was 0· gloss, suggested by
ς 25 above, to explain 100100, and that atquc was added to
make the gloss at home in the text. With mora reason he pro-
posed to striks 00100110, for the MS V omits it. But the
compilet 01 the selection from which this MS was copied un·
doubtedly took libertics with the text, and Jordan rightly re-
plies 10 these proposals, that 100100 by 110011 would bs 100
poetical an expression, and would mean rather ‘fondled in our
arms' (0901010001. 2. 10. 22). The urbia isno 1000 neces-
sary than intra maenia 10 fix the meaning 01 aaa (the senate).
Jordan quotes Aurelius Victor, inter impleas urbia 01900 ipsc
0100 (sc. arbit) praetoriae manua acic 01010100, and Tac. H. 3. 38
ia arbe 00 sinu cauendam 1001001, and Vogel still merc aptly
from Hsgesippus, 0 great imitator of Sallust-ta 010010 arbit
aicta: ia erbis atnam: ia medio 0100 urbis id eet Romano foro.

36. quare erc 110 censeo] Tha transposition ita 090
which is found in some MSS is due to the initiative 01 the
compilet 01 the selection from which V is derived. The earlier
position 01 090, after the first word in the sentence is vary
common in Sallust, cp. 01900 090 laec 51. 353 10090 mihi clia
52. 23 sed 090 baec omitto 52. 243 aed mibi matta 1090011 53. 23
compertam 090 babeo 58. 13 etc. Cp. J. 85. 1, where Marius
begins his speech, 00 0010 the Censor often did, with the
words Scio 090 Quirites. It 1ιο0 been proposed 10 striks out
the 090 hers. Caesar says (51. 43) 0001100000οο, Philippus (Or.
21) quare tta 000000. Βο1 the 090 10 probably intended 10 bs
characteristic of (tato’s speaking. Op. ξ 5 000090 appellc;

Sallust’s account 01 Oato’e speech is probably 0 far 1000
accurate account than his version 01 0000010. 1110 not only
that it is the speech 01 an older man than 0010 then was (see
§5 7, 8) and that the style 10 completely Sallustian‚ but that
whatever we are told by other authorities that 0010 said 10
absent from Sallust’s peges. Plutarch (001013, 0000. 8, 010.
21) says that he sharply rebuked Silanus for his change 01
view, that he inveighed at length against 0000οτ, snd 010010
(οᾶ stt. 12. 21. 1) declares that 0010 extollsd him 10 the siries,
tor one thing and another. 01 all that we hear nothing from
Sallust, except 0 short insinuation against 000001. 'Phia says
Plutarch ξω. 23) 10 the only extant speech 01 Oato’s, ior
Cicero’s s ort-hand writers took it down. Sallust however

was it may be supposed anxious 10 make the speech as iar 00
