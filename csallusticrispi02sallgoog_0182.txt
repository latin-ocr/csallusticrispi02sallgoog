paratis ut videbantur magula coplts] videbantur instead
of videbatur of the best MSS. Perhaps, as Fabri says, uideor
is always used personally in such a parenthesis, but at any rate
the plural seems necessary here to show that the meaning is
not ‘when they had got ready forces which seemed to them
preet', but ‘when their iorces were as it seemed to them νοσοῖμ’.

Faesulanum] is certainly surprising. For one gathers from
S. himself, 32. 2, 43. 2, 44. 6, that the plan was that the
conspiratura should not carry the incendiarism and massaore
into execution till Catiline, coming from Faesulae, had got
close to Rome; and that ior the reason that (lio. in (lat. 3. 4.
S gives (ut) praesto esset ille, qui et sepientes exciperet etse
eum hie urbanis ducibus coniungeret. And not only that, but
Bestia would not be tribune till 10 Deo„ while we are led to
suppose in 36. 1-3 that Catiline had already reached Faesulae
long before that date. There is therefore a general agreement
among the commentatore that S. did not write Faesulanum.
Dietsoh has suggested Goreuleuum (Carsulae near Narnia in
Umbria) and Trossuleuum (Trossulum near Volsinii in Etruria).
Aeeuteuum (Aesulae near Tibur) has also been proposed, and
Wirz suggests more oautiously suburbanum. It may however
be questioned whether the slip or mistake is not Sallust’s own;
and nota scribe’s. upplan, who undoubtedly took his account
ol the conspiracy from S.‚ has the same mistaks. B. C. 2. 3.
Λέντλῳ δὲ καὶ τοῖς συνωμόταις ἔδοξεν ὅτε Κατιλίναν ἐν Φαισούλαις

σίαν εὐθὺς ὑπὸ κήρυξι συνάγειν καὶ κατηγορεῖν τοῦ Κικέρωνος. And

The Saturnalia were on 19 Dee. Sallust gives no date, but a
coctio eould not be held on the day oi the Saturnalia. Perhaps
the plan was originallyfixed fer 10 Dee-the day of Bestia’s
entry upon his office, but when no tidings oame of Catiline’s
approach, the execution was postponed to 19 Deo„ in spite of
the protests of Cethegus.
