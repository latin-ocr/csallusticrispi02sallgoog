INYRODUOTION. ix

private life was bad. No doubt there is mnoh‘ex-
aggeration: allowanoe must be made for party spite,

and for the satisfaction which rhetorioians have found .

in reokless defamation⁵. The truth perhaps may be
that Sallust’s life was not exceptional for excess in
those ,disturbed times, and that we should not have
heard so muoh about it, if it had not been for the

marked oontrast between the excuses he makes for
himself⁶ and his unsparing condemnation of others,

historia notiones οοτιτοτίοο fieri atque exerceri ον’ἀεοιμο, in
adtherto ab Annio Milone loris bene caeram dicit, et, eam
dedisset pecuniam, dimissam. The story is also mentioned by
Servius on Verg. A. 6. 612, and by a scholiast on Hor. Sat. 1.
2. 41, who takes it from Asconius' life oi Sallust, whioh is un-
fortunately lost.

⁵ Lenaeus, a freedman of Pompeius, and aiter his patron’s
death asohoolmaster, revenged himself on Sallust, ior deserib-
ing P. aa orta probi aaiaro inverecundo, with grem vigour.
(Suet. de Gramm. 15.) What reokless defamation oan do is
shown by the writer oi the invective oi Oioero against Sallust,
ivah appears in many editions oi Sallust's worka.

θ In what he says oi himself however in the prefatas to the
Catilina and Juguaha Sallust is thinking perhaps rather of

literary ornamentation than of autobiographieal details, ior he
is only translating Plato's Seventh hetter. Op. Νέος ἐγώ ποτε

where S. borrows irom the same letter further on. The ourious
