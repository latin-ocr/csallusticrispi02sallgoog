Graeciae morem imitati] Dtderlein objected to these
words as placed in the Mes ‘What is the point of the intro-
ductory remarks about the receptivity of the Romans for
good institutione of foreigh lande, if the lec Porcia is not to be
represented as a foreign importationi' But the transposition
recommended by him—to after coepere tum ἓ 40, would give
us there an unendurably awkward sentence. Dietsch‚ who urges
this among other objections to the suggested transposition, yet
for his part regards the words as a gloss. ‘The ancestors' he
says ‘will then not appear to be so very wise after all’. But ii
the words are struck out, then the remarks about Roman
receptivity will indeed be irrelevant. clearly the words must
be explained as they stand—Omnia mula exempla ec bonis
orta curet. Oapital punishment, for instance, is not a bad insti·
tution‚ if it ean be kept from abuse. Our ancestors are to be
praised for introducing, and still more for abolishing it, when
it was found to be abused. And between the lines no doubt
Cacsar is attempting to excite prejudice against the punish·
ment of death by describing it as an un-Rcman and exotic
practice-an crpumentura cd Catonem.

Whether the words are left as they are or transposed they
will be equally untrue. But it was supposed that the Twelve
Tables were drawn up under Greek influence (Liv. 3. 31. 8) and
oi them likely enough S. was thinking-he was not infallible.
Sehb'll suggests that S. borrowed the idea from Varro. Servius

perc] The constructiones a passive infinitiva with the active ’
oi coepi—a construction unknown to Oicero and (laesar, und
rare in Livy, though usual in Tacitus-occurs occasionally in
S. J. 41. 10 moveri cicitur et diaconato civilis quasi permixtio
terrae oriri coepit. G. 12. l darei eoepit. J. 92. 1 haberi coepit.
Observe that a genuine passive is in none of these instantes
used by itself. With regard to another point as to the oon·
struction of coepi, it is not used in the Catilina without an
infinitiva, though often elsewhere (J. (52.7 cum primum deditio
coepit)—a use of the word avoided by (licere.
