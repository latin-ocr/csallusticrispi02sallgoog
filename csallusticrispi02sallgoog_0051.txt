things may of course have occurred.

· Iu the critical edition of Dietsch‚ which appeared
inlate, the elassification of the MSS. proposed by Roth
was accepted, and the oldest MSS. were given some-
thing oi the authority they deserved. But, unfor-
tunately, it was found by Jordan and Wirz that the
collation of the two or three of the oldest MSS. was
far from correct. At the present time, not all the
MSS. of the first alass have been collated 3 but Jordan
has done a great service in determining which of
the oldest MSS, as far as they are known, are oi the
most importance. The chief result at which he has
arrived is, thatthe oldest MS. we have is also the best, Ι
that it is the main foundation on which the text must
be built⁰. The accuracy of the recension of this MS,
which Jordan gave out in 1866, has, in all material
pointS, been abundantly estabhshed by Wirz‚ who had
previously collated it, and by others.

This leading MS, which belongs to the tenth, or
perhaps to the ninth century, is preserved at Paris,

The words cate diem in J. 113. 3, owing to mutilation, are the
last decipherable words ol the MS.
