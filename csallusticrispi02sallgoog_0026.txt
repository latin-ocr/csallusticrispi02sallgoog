INTRODUOTJON. xix

originally fixed and some early day in October astho
day on which, after a postponement, they were ac·
tually held.

But such 1 dating would be 111 from clearing
away 111 difficulties. The proper time for holding the
consular Comitia at this period was Ju1y¹⁹. Howis
it then that we hear nothing of this double postporie·
ment, along 111, from J uly to 2lst October or other
day about that time, and a shorter one, from that day
to 28611 October, unless it be that in fact the Oomitia
was 111111 short adjournmcnt held in the usual
11111611 11 J uly²⁰l

Against thet theory there is nothing but the
consideration to which the orthodox view is pre-
sumably due—the consideration namely that, if
Oatiline's preparatione for open revolution had been

latter 6ο what date of the old calendar the date given would
correspond. Mommsen has suggested 1 variety 11 dates in his
different writings‚ from 20 Oct. to,4 Nov.

1⁹ Mommsen, R. S. 12. 565, 1161 3. John, 74911. The con-
sular Comitia can be shown to have been held before the
end of July in the years 604, 693, 694, 696, 700, 703, 704.

²⁰ Putting the Comitia in July clears up many 1 little diffi-
culty. For' instance Mur. ξ 62, hia tam rebus 1111111111, et
qaod 1111111111 iam tam coniuratos cam pladite ta campum
deduci a Catilina sciebam descendi ia campum cum firmissimo
praesidio, etc. Can Cicero pride himself on knowing already
V 11 the 28611 Oct. that there was 1 conspiracy? Clearly not, and

the passage therefore has greatly troubled the commentatore .

But 11 the election took place in July there is no difficulty.
How, again, can Cicero have argued that there was nothing
very compromising in (laelius and others having supported
the candidature 11 the election took place 11 the midst of mili·
tary preparatione for violence?
