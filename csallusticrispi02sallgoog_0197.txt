tieem perpetuae indireotly abolished the death penalty alto·
gether (see Maiue’s Aneient Lau. oh. 10), for they could inflict
no more than outlawry (aquae et ipnir interdictio)—praeti·
sully, that is, exile. It is to this practiaal abolition of the
death penalty that Caesar alludes in the following words—at
aliae tepet...eeiliurn permitti iubent. and in ς 40. That Sal·
lust is right in not making Caesar allude to the lea Sempronia
(by name at any rate), however apposite lt may be to the pre·
sent occasion, is not improbable. The l. Porcia was, so tar
as it concerned scourging, a law of generally recognized valid-
ity‚ while the l. Sempronia was extremely unpalatable to
the senate3 and more than that, Caesar by his presence and
proposal laid himself open to the charge that he was infringing
that law: op. (lic. in Cat. ts. 10 Video de istie, qui ee popu-
laret treberi volunt, abesse reon ruminemus decapite uidelicet
ciuium Romanarum sententiam ferat...At uero 0. Onetor intel·

· ἰερίε, lepem Semproniam ecee de civibus Romanis amntitutam

qui autern reipublicae eit leuatis eum ciuem nullo nudo esee
posae; deniqne ipsum latorem Semproniae legia iniussu populi
poenae rei publicae depertdiese. (‘The argument of Cicero, that
the men were hostes not ciues, was a mere evasion ς ior their
trus character had only been prejudged ‘by the sotatur ammiel
tum altimum, the constitutional validity of which had been
reeently called in question in the case ot Rabirius, which was
a moral defeat tor the senate ’. Heitland’s edition of the p.
Rabirio, p. 1de where a lull discussion of the leges Porciae etc
will be foun .)

24. tn minore negotio] Negotium is often used by S. :rea
cp. J. 6. 2 Micipsa...vebementer eo nepotis pennotus (the grow-
ing importante oi Jugurtha); J. te. t infecto rugeti03 J. 107. 6
ea ree uti in tali nepotio probata.

neglegens] Jordan reads in the same way J.40. 1, nep-
lepieset (though P has nepleaiseet), Or. Lep. 23 intelleperint
(V intellegerent), J. 6. 2 intellepit (t present). S. often uses
the other form of the perient of intellepo, but thetis not
against this reading. It is strange, however, that no gram·
marian notices these old forms.

25. tempus dies] tempus, time with its inevitable changes
of circumstances. dies, time in its inevitable advenae. Livy
also puts the words together 2. 45. 2 diem tempusque forsitan
ipnem leniturum iras.

26. ceterum] ‘but ’‚ not a Ciceronian use.

ut. omnia mele exempla ex rebus bonis orta sunt. seu]
En rebus bonu would meon ‘irem a prosperous condition oi
