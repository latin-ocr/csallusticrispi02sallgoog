5. vindices rerum capitelium] Mommsen (R. S. 1⁸. 581.
n.) takes the o. r. c. to be the tresviri capitales mentioned above
(op. Cic. de Legg. 3. 3. 6 vinculo sontium aemonio, copitalia
vindicavero), and concludes thatthese officere strangled Lentulus
with their own hande. Is it possible that these dignified ehiefs
of the police, who had concurrent authority with the esdilee

que suis iritum reperiunt), and in Hegesippus—a constant
imitator-bic toli diynus exitu Μῦς exitum vitoe invenire;
ita ciprum auritis suis vitae emtam tulit. The Me authority
however ior exitium is too strong, and the explanation of the
word probably is that it does not mean ‘miserable end’, but
that ecitinm=ecitum. Exitium antiqui periebant pro crinem:
ruric erilium pessimum exitum dicimus. Festus.
