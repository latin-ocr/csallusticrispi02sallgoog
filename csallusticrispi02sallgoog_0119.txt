(lh. 1-2, 2] Argument :-The aim of 1110 should be to leave
0 noble name behind us. This obieot is to be attained by the
employment, not oi the body but of the mind-the nobler part.
In whatever path ol life one may choose‚ the mind is ca ,able
of greater things than the body. 1110111111 is 101101 een
proved (1) in the struggles 01 war; though (2) 111 the public
affairs oi peace (0101)]1110 mind has not been allowed to show its
supremacy: hereret er do we note the disorder which exclusive
devotionto our lower nature produces. (3) In the practical
affairs oi private life too itis only by strenuous exercise 01 011
higher wers that success and 101110 010 achieved. (4) And
lastly emind ean win for one who uses his taleut a name
in the sphere oi historical literature.

Something 01 the kind seems 10 be the thread 01 this intro-
duction, but the theme is treated in a somewhat confused
lashion Perhaps Sallust felt that himself, ior the prelace to
the Jugurtha handles almost the very same ideas 101 more
successfully. What is bere as Mr Simcox rather too severely
says ‘wirigid mass ol aphorisms' becomes there a really
‘moving pisce 01 eloquenoe '.

, Both these prefaces are justlycensuredby Quintilian (3. 8. 9)

as having nothing to do with history—he attributes them to imi·
tation 011100101οε and Gorgias. But it must be remembered
that Sallust was attempting something of a new departure.
Historieal writing‚ at the time when he set himself to the task,
was in low repnte. Even the most distinguished 01 his prede·
cessors‚ M. Cornelius Sisenna, isnot thought much of by Cicero
(Legg. 1. 2. 7 Siceuua...omuis adbuc costros scriptores...sacile
superavit: 10 101100...10 historic puerile quiddam 0000110101-
and cp. Brutus 64. 228). 11 was· not then unnatural that

’ Sallust should sech, as he does in this introduction, to claim

1011110 historian and his work a higher consideration.
