that succisura has often to he called in. Sallust himself seems
to have grown tired of the word. In the Ο. it isquiteascornmon
as cgere, but in the iugurtha, and still-more again in the
Histories, cgere comes more into use in its placa Itis said
that S. got to use frequentatives generally less and less. That
is perhaps rather doubtful· but the following occur only in the
0.—ecercitcrc rogitare adflictare amplexari capture vocure, but
these, except the last, occur only once there. ,

2. habere] not=putcrc, but to tuve in their lust of rule a
reason for war.

. putare] ‘to find ’. Therses is always omitted after putare
r byS. Op. J. 85. 21 eorum sortia scota wumuuwdo clariores
acce puteat, etc. For the turn-of which S. is fond-cp. 0. 43.

plures praesidium iu eo putabunt. J. 53. 3 dum iu elephantis
auritium putabunt.

periculo atque negotiis] Nonius quotes this to show that
sometimes periculuru=ecperimeutum (cp. (lass. B. G. 1. 40. 5
suctum cius hostis periculum potrum uestrorum mensoria).
But it is rather a hendiadys, ‘hazardous affairs’. So says
Macaulay, 1v. 409, writing of the battle of handen. The lot
of the two generals (‘the hunchbaclred dwarf '-Luxembourg‚
and the ‘asthmatic skeleton’-William) “ had fallen on a time
when men had discovered that the strength of the muscles is
far inferior in value to the strength of the mind.''

3. The connexion is perhaps-Rulers have discovered the
superiority which astrenuous use of the mind gives in uam
that the same holds good in peuce they do not appear to have
discovered, though it is no less true.

regum atque imperatorum] The second isthe more com·
prehensive word (=rulers whatever their title), as in periculo
atquc negotiis above; and perhaps regum in reference to Cyrus,
and irrep in reference to the Greeks.

nsque allud] Ο. W. Nauck remarks that the first ueqrre
here does double duty: it serves both to connect this clause
with the preceding, and also answers to the following aeque-
‘and you would see neither general distraction nor confusion
worse confounded’. It may be questioned howswar w‘nefnan
